# Starter for deploying [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) models on [Render](https://render.com)

This repo is originally forked from https://github.com/render-examples/fastai-v3, which can be used as a starting point to deploy [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) models on Render.

The starter app described here is up at https://fastai-v3.onrender.com. You could test it out with bear images!

The guide for production deployment to Render is at https://course.fast.ai/deployment_render.html.

You could use [Render's fast.ai forum thread](https://forums.fast.ai/t/deployment-platform-render/33953) for general web deployment questions and support.
